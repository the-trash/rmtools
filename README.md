### RMTools
[github](https://github.com/tinbka/rmtools)

Collection of helpers for any need: strings, enumerables, modules... hundreds of bicycles and shortcuts you ever wanted to implement are here, optimized for performance.
Small dev library (constantly in progress): fast and smart logger, binding explorer, backtrace formatter, each is console-colored.
Started from basic classes, now it contains low-level helpers for ActiveRecord and makes LibXML more jqueryish.

RMTools helps to throw away some boiler-plate making a code more intuitive. It comes with almost no (<< 10%) performance penalty:
* `hash[:id]` -> `hash.id`
* `ary.map(&:id)` -> `ary.ids`
* `ary.map {|h| h[:id]}` -> `ary.ids`
* `comments.posts.sorted_uniq_by_id.select_by_user_id(user_id).sum_points` -> `comments.map {|c| c.post}.sort_by {|p| p.id}.uniq_by {|p| p.id}.select {|p| p.user_id == user_id}.sum {|p| p.points}`

It's still randomly documented since it's just my working tool.

#### Wanted to implement

* Ruby code parser (StringScanner-based) reading an array of loaded ruby-files and making accurate hash-table of defined methods {"Class#method" => "def ... end"}
* JSON-formatter for output ruby objects content in HTML presentation in order to inspect big objects using browser graphic abilities
* Set theory based Range extension with support of both begin and end exclusion, and satisfying the next rules:
  * `size(0..1) = size(0...1) = 1`
  * `A = A - B | B`
  *   `A ⊃ B -> size(A - B) = size(A) - size(B)`


### CHANGES

##### Version 2.3.4

* Ruby 2+ behaviour:
  * Disabled C-extension
  * Used String#encode instead of Iconv#iconv
  
* String
  * Updated #digit_date to parse full english month names

##### Version 2.2.6

* String
  * Added #utf? and #find_compatible_encoding. Currently, latter one differentiates only utf-8 and ansi-1251.

* Range
  * #include? never raises an exception

* Array/Set
  * Added #is_subset_of?

##### Version 2.2.4

* Hash
  * #key_value = to_a.first

* Array
  * #fold[l,r]_<method> now passes up to 2 arguments to fold itself
  * Aliased sort_along_by => order_by
  
* Dir
  * Fixed #content for dirs with dotted files only
  * #content now accepts :recursive and :include_dot options turned off by default
  
* Range
  * #min/#max return #first/#last if called with no block
  
* Removed "-module" ld_flag from extconf.rb

##### Version 2.2.2

* Enumerable
  * Added #truth_map. Hash#truth_map maps values to booleans
  
* File
  * Added ::file? pathname check to ::modify iterator

##### Version 2.2.1

* ::RMLogger
  * Aliased #info -> #puts to be able to set RMLogger as default logger wherever it's possible
  * Added #get_config
  
* ::Painter
  * #method_missing now accepts :"_<effect key>" as well as :"<color key>[_<effect key>]"
  * Aliased "purple_bold" as "violet", "v"

##### Version 2.2.0

* Added ::FileWatcher
  * Constantly checks files updated in a directory and does some action whenever a update has been met
  * A subclass, ::ScpHelper copies updated files to specified host

##### Version 2.1.1

* Array
  * Added #any and #none to iterators pattern
  
* Hash
  * Fixed #any? (and removed it for Ruby>=1.9)

##### Version 2.1.0

* Array
  * For ruby >= 1.9.3 #uniq_by[!] is alias of #uniq[!] itself, since it’s native implementation appears to be ~1.4x faster
  * A bit better english singularizer for iterators
  * Added #partition_by iterator
  
* Enumerable
  * Generalized faster set operations for Array and Set (see rmtools/enumerable/set_ops)
  * Boosted &-operator
* ActiveRecord::Base
  * Added #update_attributes?

##### Version 2.0.0

* Array Meta-iterators
  * Pattern has became a class variable. New names can be added to pattern by Array::add_iterator_name
  * Speed has been drastically boosted by evaluating of every proper missing method. (Read comments in /enumerable/array_iterators.rb)
  * Using meta-iterators in the new behaviour can smudge Array instance_methods namespace. Although it's not something that bad, that's possible to turn on the old behaviour by Array::fallback_to_clean_iterators!

* Hash#method_missing
  * hash.something gets hash[:something] || hash['something'], not other way
  * hash.something= sets hash['something'] as did it before
  * This change has been caused by large amounts of symbolic options keys and json decode returning symbolic keys (at least with a yajl library).
  * Set behaviour, on the other hand, will not be changed since 1) it will be too hard to debug hashes in an old code; 2) it's not that frequently used; 3) setting hash key directly by :[]= makes a code clearer
  
* Class
  * Added private #alias_constant

* Array
  * Fixed #avg, #avg_by, #rand_by in case of an empty array: return nil
  * Added #intersects? (alias #x?)
  * Added #rfind_by, #runiq_by and few more iterators

* Symbol
  * Added #+, #split and #method_missing to proxy all possible methods to #to_s

* Range
  * Specified a concept of the extension (/enumerable/range.rb)
  * Changed default Range#include? the way it can take range as argument
  * Added XRange#first(count) and #last(count), analogically to Range#first and #last

* ActiveRecord
  * Moved declarative.rb from Rhack project. ::Base::declarative is a way of making tables like by migrations but on the fly
  * Added ::Base#with_same(<column_name>)
  * ::Base::non_null_scopes ignores non-nullable columns

* Development kit
  * RMTools::timer now resets $quiet and $log.mute_warn to previous values in case of ^C or another exception raised
  * Fixed all potential problems with /dev, so require "rmtools_dev" is deprecated in favour of require "rmtools" and will be removed in the next update
  * Read comments about format_trace in /dev/trace_format.rb
  * BlackHole class is aliased as Void
  * Added :detect_comments and :precede_comments options to ::RMLogger to automatically highlight comment blocks get logged

* Structural changes
  * Moved /b.rb into /core since #b is proved usability through some years
  * Renamed /db into /active_record
  * Merged /ip into /conversions
  * The gem is now being produced in the bundle style: added Gemfile, .gemspec, etc

  * key :js_caller to #parse for JS stacktrace lines as it given by stacktrace.js library
* Added ActiveRecord::Base::boolean_scopes! and ::non_null_scopes!
* Added Object#ifndef for ivars caching
* Fixed bugs
  * Class#__init__ (case with nested classes)
  * ActiveRecord::Base::select_rand (case with :where query)
  * ::rw and ::write (cases with encoding fail and non-string argument)

##### Version 1.2.8

* StringScanner#each changed to compare `cbs' keys with @matched by number in ruby 1.8 and by first character in ruby 1.9, since ?x in 1.9 returns string instead of a charcode
* Updated LibXML::XML::XPath to search elements with multiple classes

##### Version 1.2.7

* String#hl and #ghl: console-highlight pattern in string
* True#call and False#call in order to pass boolean values as callable argument

* Added couple of handlers into Array#method_missing
* File.modify now can process files by glob-patterns and correctly use multiple gsub! inside passed block
* RMTools.read now can read from list of files in order
* Upped RMTools.timer accuracy
* Optimized Array#-, #+, #& and #| for when one of arrays is empty; added Array#diff
* Optimized Object#to_json and String#from_json: use JSON stdlib for ruby 1.9. Object#to_json_safe: timeout'ed conversion
* String#cut_line and #split_to_lines optimized for use in Ruby 1.9
* Removed String#bytes because it duplicate ruby 1.9 method
* static VALUE rb_ary_count_items moved from Array#count to Array#arrange
* Fixed Module#self_name
* RMTools::CodeReader is still unstable though

* Slightly extended StringScanner
* Proof of concept: Regexp reverse (wonder if someone did it earlier in Ruby)
* Kernel#whose? to find classes and/or modules knowing some method
